We really need to preserve the version history of all artifacts and wanted to see if there is an import utility available to do this.  If not, we can go through and import off of our milestone baselines in separate workspaces but this can be fairly time consuming for us to grab all needed baselines that we will want to preserve.  We are not planning on archiving RTC so getting the history out for all versioned artifacts is extremely important.
